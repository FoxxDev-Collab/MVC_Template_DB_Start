FINANCE.APP - PLANNING DOCUMENT
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple, family-focused finance tracker for budgeting, expense tracking, and 
net worth monitoring. Integrates with HomeAssetTracker.App for asset valuations.

NOT a replacement for enterprise tools like Quicken/YNAB - this is homelab-scale
tracking focused on visibility and awareness, not complex accounting.

---------------------------------------------
- Manual expense entry (date, amount, category, description)
- Income tracking
- Basic categories (Groceries, Gas, Entertainment, Utilities, etc.)
- Monthly/yearly summary views
- Simple filtering by date range and category

Phase 2: Budget Management (Months 3-4)
----------------------------------------
- Monthly budget creation (category-based)
- Budget vs actual tracking
- Visual indicators (over/under budget)
- Rollover handling (if under budget, carry forward?)
- Budget templates for recurring months

Phase 3: Net Worth Tracking (Months 5-6)
-----------------------------------------
- Manual asset entry (bank accounts, investments, retirement)
- Integration with HomeAssetTracker for physical asset values

Phase 4: Reports & Insights (Months 7-8)
-----------------------------------------

NetWorthSnapshots

Assets (Integration Point)
---------------------------
- Pull current values from HomeAssetTracker.App
- Map asset types to financial categories
- Include in net worth calculations


USER STORIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a family member, I want to:
- Quickly log an expense from my phone (mobile-friendly input)
- See how much I've spent this month in each category
- Know if we're over/under budget without doing math
- Track our net worth growth over time
- See where our money actually goes each month

As the primary finance manager, I want to:
- Set monthly budgets that reflect our actual spending patterns
- See trends over 6-12 months to identify problems
- Export data for tax preparation
- Track both shared and individual expenses
- Get reminders about recurring bills


TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database Schema: PostgreSQL 'finance' schema
Authentication: Shared ASP.NET Identity (FoxxLab.Shared.Auth)
UI Framework: Bootstrap with modern overrides (consistent with Dashboard.App)

Integration Points:
- HomeAssetTracker.App API for asset valuations
- Shared authentication for single sign-on
- Optional: Dashboard.App widget showing current month budget status

Security Considerations:
- Financial data is sensitive - encrypt at rest
- Role-based access (some family members may have read-only access)
- Audit log for all changes to accounts/transactions

Mobile Responsiveness:
- CRITICAL: Expense entry must work well on phones
- Dashboard view should be mobile-friendly
- Charts should scale appropriately


PHASE 1 DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week 1-2: Foundation
- Project scaffolding
- Database schema creation
- Basic authentication integration
- Account management CRUD

Week 3-4: Transaction Entry
- Transaction CRUD operations
- Category management
- Mobile-optimized expense entry form
- Basic transaction list view

Week 5-6: Monthly Summary
- Current month spending by category
- Simple income vs expense view
- Basic filtering and search

Week 7-8: Polish & Testing
- UI refinement for spouse acceptance
- Mobile testing on actual devices
- Family user acceptance testing
- Bug fixes and adjustments


SUCCESS METRICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 1 Success:
- Can enter 20+ transactions without frustration
- Spouse uses it without asking for help
- Mobile entry takes <30 seconds per transaction
- Monthly summary answers "where did our money go?"

Long-term Success:
- Daily active use for expense tracking
- Monthly budget review becomes routine
- Net worth tracking shows progress over time
- Reduces "surprise" expenses through awareness


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Post-Phase 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Receipt photo attachment for transactions
- Automatic transaction import (bank CSV uploads)
- Bill payment reminders
- Savings goals tracking
- Split transactions (shared expenses)
- Multi-currency support (if international travel)
- Tax category tagging for deductions


NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep it simple. This is NOT enterprise accounting software.

Focus on awareness and visibility, not complex financial modeling.

The goal is to answer: "Where does our money go?" and "Are we on track?"

If it takes more than 30 seconds to log an expense, it won't get used.

Spouse acceptance factor is CRITICAL - if it's not intuitive, it fails.
